	<p>This recipe for my mom's chocolate chip cookies is a family favorite. It's the perfect treat for any occasion, and I remember making them with her every Sunday afternoon. She always said, <blockquote>"The secret to a good cookie is a little extra love."</blockquote></p>
<p>A great tip for this recipe is to chill the dough for at least 30 minutes before baking. This helps the cookies maintain their shape and gives them a richer flavor. You can also substitute milk chocolate chips for dark chocolate chips if you prefer a sweeter cookie.</p>
